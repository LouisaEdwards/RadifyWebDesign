Gestalt Principles of Design 
1. Figure-ground - people instintively perceive objects as either being in the foreground or the background 
2. Similarity - when things appear to be similar to each other, we group them together and tend to think that they have the same function 
3. Proximity - things that are close together appear to be more related than things that are far apart 
4. Common Region - when objects are located in the same closed region, we perceive them as being grouped together 
5. Continuity - elements arranged on a line or curve appear to be more related than elements not on line or curve
6. Closure - when looking at a complex arrangement of elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern --> when presented an image with missing parts, your brain will fill in the blanks and make a complete image
7. Focal point - whatever stands out visually will capture and hold the viewer's attention first
